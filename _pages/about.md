<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With a strong foundation in machine learning, I've had the opportunity to work with a range of cutting-edge libraries, including Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. Through hands-on experience, I've developed a comprehensive skill set that enables me to tackle complex data challenges, from preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model selection and evaluation. I'm now expanding my expertise by exploring the capabilities of TensorFlow, a leading deep learning framework. As a committed lifelong learner, I'm dedicated to continually refining my skills and applying them to drive meaningful impact in real-world scenarios. Let's collaborate and explore the possibilities!
